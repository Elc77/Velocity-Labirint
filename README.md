# Labirint
This is my maze/labyrinth school project, built as an HTML page. First, I generated a maze with a solvable path. Then, I converted the code to use the Canvas element and added an animation to visualize the pathfinding process. Additionally, I implemented a speed slider with 15 levels, allowing users to adjust the animation speed dynamically.

<h3>After Animation, if speed value is set on 14 or less</h3>
